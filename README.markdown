retryable gem
=====

![travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/nfedyashev/retryable.png)

Description
--------

Runs a code block, and retries it when an exception occurs. It's great when
working with flakey webservices (for example).

It's configured using four optional parameters --`:tries`, `:on`, `:sleep`, `:matching`--, and
runs the passed block. Should an exception occur, it'll retry for (n-1) times.

Should the number of retries be reached without success, the last exception
will be raised.


Examples
--------

Open an URL, retry up to two times when an `OpenURI::HTTPError` occurs.

``` ruby
require "retryable"
require "open-uri"

retryable( :tries => 3, :on => OpenURI::HTTPError ) do
  xml = open( "http://example.com/test.xml" ).read
end
```

Do _something_, retry up to four times for either `ArgumentError` or 
`TimeoutError` exceptions.

``` ruby
require "retryable"

retryable( :tries => 5, :on => [ ArgumentError, TimeoutError ] ) do
  # some crazy code
end
```

## Defaults

    :tries => 2, :on => Exception, :sleep => 1, :matching  => /.*/ 

Sleeping
--------
By default Retryable waits for one second between retries. You can change this and even provide your own exponential backoff scheme.

```
retryable(:sleep => 0) { }                # don't pause at all between retries
retryable(:sleep => 10) { }               # sleep ten seconds between retries
retryable(:sleep => lambda { |n| 4**n }) { }   # sleep 1, 4, 16, etc. each try
```    

Matching error messages
--------
You can also retry based on the exception message:

```
retryable(:matching => /IO timeout/) do |retries, exception|
  raise "yo, IO timeout!" if retries == 0
end
```

Block Parameters
--------
Your block is called with two optional parameters: the number of tries until now, and the most recent exception.

```
retryable do |retries, exception|
  puts "try #{retries} failed with exception: #{exception}" if retries > 0
  pick_up_soap
end
```

Installation
-------

Install the gem:

``` bash
$ gem install retryable
```

Add it to your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'retryable'
```


## Changelog

*  v1.2.5: became friendly to any rubygems version installed
*  v1.2.4: added :matching option + better options validation
*  v1.2.3: fixed dependencies
*  v1.2.2: added :sleep option
*  v1.2.1: stability -- Thoroughly unit-tested
*  v1.2: FIX -- block would run twice when `:tries` was set to `0`. (Thanks for the heads-up to [Tuker](http://github.com/tuker).)
